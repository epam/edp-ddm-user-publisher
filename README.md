# user-publisher


### Overview

The main purpose of the application is to import users from a csv file to Keycloak. Ð¡sv file, located in Ceph bucket and encrypted with vault.

The application runs like a kubernetes job. It starts, receives, as command line arguments, the id of the csv file, the access_token of the user who launched 
the import of users and the request_id that the user sent to start the import of users.

The workflow:

* Get csv file from Ceph bucket
* Decrypt file using Vault
* Get all users from Keycloak and if there are users in the file that duplicate users from Keycloak, then skip them
* Split the list of all users into groups of M users.
* Submit a request to Keycloak to import M users. If at least one user has become corrupted and Keycloak returned a 500 error, then import users from this batch one by one.
* For each successfully imported user, an audit log is sent to Kafka, which then gets into the database using Kafka Connect.
* When all users are imported, the application stops and the pod is destroyed. Logs can be viewed in kibana.
